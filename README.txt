This is the barneymcfirst directory. Last example is a half-working jqTouch application loading from a database (which
probably is empty as the REBUILD flag is prob resetting).

1. Google Maps and jqTouch producing strange results...
2. Have a populated database.db on barneymc/FindPitch that contains the clubs required....
3. Now do the index.html etc similar to iCCPC - multiple pages....
